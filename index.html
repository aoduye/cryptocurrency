             <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptocurrency for security.<br> 
             A cryptocurrency is difficult to counterfeit because of this security feature. 
             <br>A defining feature of a cryptocurrency, and arguably it most endearing allure, 
             is its organic nature; it is not issued by any cetral authority, rending it theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation. </p>

             <h2>Cryptocurrency History</h2>  
             <img src="images/bitcoin.jpg">
             <p>The first cryptocurrency to capture the public imagination was Bitcoin, which was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. 
             As of September 2015, there were over 14.6 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market value of $3.4 billion. 
             Bitcoin's success has spawned a number of competing cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin, Namecoin and PPCoin.</p>

             <h2>Cryptocurrency Benefits</h2> 
             <img src="images/cryptocurrencypeople.jpg" width="600px">
             <p>Cryptocurrencies make it easier to transfer funds between two parties in a transaction; 
              these transfers are facilitated through the use of public and private keys for security purposes. 
              These fund transfers are done with minimal processing fees, allowing users to avoid the steep fees 
              charged by most banks and financial institutions for wire transfers.</p>

              <h2>Cryptocurrency Drawbacks</h2>  
              <img src="images/bitcoinhack.jpg" width="600px">
              <p>Cryptocurrencies are not immune to the threat of hacking. In Bitcoin's short history, the company has been subject to over 40 thefts, 
              including a few that exceeded $1 million in value. Still, many observers look at cryptocurrencies as hope that a currency can exist that preserves value, 
              facilitates exchange, is more transportable than hard metals, and is outside the influence of central banks and governments.</p>
